## Why Ethocrypt
<p align = "justify">
Unlike other crypto transaction wallets, Ethocrypt uniquely does the transaction. When we do a transaction a gif or a meme will also be stored as pair in the blockchain with the address of the sender or receiver. This gif or meme will be visible on the dashboard along with other information. This makes it look unique.
